# Fenics-reinforcement
FEniCS-reinforcement (name WIP) is a package that will let you include truss elements in a 3d mesh in FEniCSX. Currently, the trusses are hardcoded and we do not use FEniCS for the calculation of stresses and stiffness, but we add those to the stiffness matrix manually.

# How to use
```python
# TODO
```
# Installation
Clone the repository and run 
```shell
pip install -e .
```
in the cloned directory, as long as this package is in development. A conda package is planned.
