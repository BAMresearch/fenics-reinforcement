# This file creates a 3D-quadrilateral mesh. The user has to provide two points, defined by their x,y,z coordinates, that are most far away from each other, i.e. the first point might be the origin (0,0,0) and the second point might be defined by (l,w,h), meaning length, width and height. "margin" defines the distance between the margin of the concrete mesh and the reinforcement bar next to it, which is going to be implemented in the future.
